This archive source repository was found from :
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compress
which give some of the brief history of this compression based on the LZW compression 
algorithm.

These 3 part?.gz files were decompressed, placed in a folder 'compress-4.0', expanded,
and their date/time reset to the last 'revision' in the source, namely 
Revision 4.0  85/07/30  12:50:00  joe

I started my WIN32 port using these files...
